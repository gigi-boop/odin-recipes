# About This Project

This is a simple site made as an exercise for **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/ "The Odin Project Homepage")**.

The homepage simply links to three different recipe pages, which each contain an image, a brief description, and unordered and ordered lists \(ingredients and steps, respectively\).

## Learning Goals

The main learning objectives for this project are the following:

- [x] Practice writing HTML boilerplate
- [x] Use and properly structure basic HTML elements, such as:
  - `p`
  - `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.
  - `ul`, `ol`, and `li`
  - `img`
- [x] Use semantic HTML
- [x] Use alt text for images
- [x] Practice the git workflow

I've also taken the opportunity to learn and practice Markdown to write this readme.

CSS is now added. The assignment was just to do some simple typography styling, add some color, etc, but, um, I went a little overboard. But I've learned some new things and relearned some old things and accomplished things I didn't think I could!
