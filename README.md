# About This Project

This is a simple site made as an exercise for **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/ "The Odin Project Homepage")**.

The homepage simply links to three different recipe pages, which each contain an image, a brief description, and unordered and ordered lists \(ingredients and steps, respectively\).

## Learning Goals

The main learning objectives for this project are the following:

-   [x] Practice writing HTML boilerplate
-   [x] Use and properly structure basic HTML elements, such as:
    -   `p`
    -   `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, etc.
    -   `ul`, `ol`, and `li`
    -   `img`
-   [x] Use semantic HTML
-   [x] Use alt text for images
-   [x] Practice the git workflow

I've also taken the opportunity to learn and practice Markdown to write this readme.

External CSS will be added later.
